# WriteFreely

WriteFreely is a beta-version of <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Eva/FreeCreate">FreeCreate</a>, and serves as a platform for readers and writers. Users can post their own writing, browse others' writings, like writing and add it to their library, and donate to writers whose work they enjoy.

This is the FrontEnd of WriteFreely, built with React.js. To checkout the BackEnd, check out this <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Eva/phase-3-sinatra-react-project" target="_blank">repo</a>.
