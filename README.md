# WriteFreely

WriteFreely is a beta-version of <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Eva/FreeCreate">FreeCreate</a>, and serves as a platform for readers and writers. Users can post their own writing, browse others' writings, and interact with writing by liking it, adding it to their library, and flagging it for innappropriate content.

This is the frontend of WriteFreely, built with React.js. To checkout the backend, check out this <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Eva/phase-3-sinatra-react-project" target="_blank">repo</a>.
